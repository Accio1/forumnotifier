# forumnotifier
A site which sends a browser notification when there is a new post in the forums.

Currently, this is still under heavy development, and may not work as intended (or work at all).

Many features are still being added on a frequent basis, meaning that you should check back for frequent updated.

Feel free to contribute to this repository by opening an issue or pull request.
